# Data

*This folder has been added to .gitignore.*

This folder appears empty on GitHub, as it is just a common placeholder for data to live on each local machine. This helps keep data sourcing consistent when we develop our risk assessment algorithms. 

## Datasets

The datasets (with links) can be found on the root `README.md`.
