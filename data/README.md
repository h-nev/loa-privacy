# Data

*This folder has been added to .gitignore.*

This folder appears empty on GitHub, as it is just a common placeholder for data to live on each local machine. This helps keep data sourcing consistent when we develop our risk assessment algorithms. 

## Datasets

The datasets we used are from:

- [The Stanford Open Policing Project] (https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/)
