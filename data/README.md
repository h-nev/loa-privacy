# Data

*This folder has been added to .gitignore.*

This folder appears empty on GitHub, as it is just a common placeholder for data to live on each local machine. This helps keep data sourcing consistent when we develop our risk assessment algorithms. 

## Datasets

The datasets we used are from:

- [SAMHSA: Mental Health Client-Level Data (MH-CLD)](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/dataset/mental-health-client-level-data-2021-mh-cld-2021-ds0001)
